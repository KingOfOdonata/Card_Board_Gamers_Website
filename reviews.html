  <h2>The Haunted Mansion: Call of the Spirits</h2>

  <p class="read-more-wrap"><span class="read-more-target">Haunted Mansion: Call of the Spirits is a simple game of set collecting with a little action management and push your luck. At the beginning each round, an event is flipped that moves the Hitchhiking Ghosts around the board, haunting players, and adding a special effect on that round of play. Then, you place ghost cards on the board, each having different set requirements. Afterwards, each player will use three actions to collect ghosts and manage Haunt cards. Once the end game is reached, players will count up points based on ghost sets and Haunt card penalties.

<b>Presentation (Rulebook & Components):</b>
The rules are clearly laid out. The game overall is quite simple, so the rules do not have much work to do. But they provide excellent examples, highlight key rules, and just look great overall.
<br><br>
As for the components, the overall design and art is great. The illustrations on the ghost cards are incredible and I hope Disney makes an animated Haunted Mansion series. It is really really good. The board also looks amazing and only has one small issue-the crypt room is not very big and you are suppose to place multiple ghost cards in the room. Also, the Hitchhiking Ghost miniatures is wonderful (would have been cool if it glowed in the dark).

There is one big component issue-the Haunt cards. Haunt cards have numbers ranging 1-3 and are used as a penalty and a push your luck mechanic. At the end of the game, whomever has the most Haunt loses the ghost type they have the most of. The issue is the cards a very small and there are 120 of them that need to be shuffled. Not only are they hard to handle, they will wear out the edges quickly. These cards should have been cardboard tokens drawn from a bag, which reduces any need for shuffling and are easier to handle.

<b>Thematic Implementation:</b>
The art really brings the theme of Disney's Haunted Mansion to life. And the way the ghosts are assigned to certain sets works well with the ride. But, the game play really is abstract and the theme largely irrelevant. Nothing really feels like you are in the Haunted Mansion or encountering supernatural events or beings. Some of the unique ghosts score in thematic ways, like the Bride scoring for Groom ghosts. As a light game though, I really did not expect the theme to be very strong.

<b>Gameplay:</b>
The gameplay is a mix bag. It mixes in a lot of different mechanics around set collecting: action management, bluffing, board positioning, and push your luck. Unfortunately, I am not so sure all these mechanics worked as well as one hoped. While the set collecting is pretty straightforward and it is fun collecting different ghosts, how the other mechanics mix in with it kind of fall apart. I will dive into the different issues below.
<img class="covers" alt="Final Game Board" src="../Card_Board_Gamers_Website/Images/Haunted-Mansion/Haunted-Mansion-Game-Board.jpg"> 
<i>Action Management:</i> Each round you get three actions which can be spent to move, rotate the center of the board (endless hallway), collect a ghost card from your current room, duel another player, and discard a Haunt card. All of the actions are straightforward, but their values vary greatly and at times, you feel like you may not even have a third action really available that has an actual purpose(which is almost always the case round one). Often, the choices are very straightforward so little thought is really put into your actions other than where you need to get to collect the ghosts you need. But, since rotating the board is a single action, movement is not needed often.
<img class="covers" alt="Seance Room" src="../Card_Board_Gamers_Website/Images/Haunted-Mansion/Seance-Room.jpg">
<i>Bluffing (Dueling):</i> There is a mechanic in the game called Dueling where you can try to steal a card from another player by secretly betting Haunt cards (by gaining 0-3 Haunt cards). This is the majority of the direct player interaction. While the mechanic is an interesting concept, in all three of my games, it was only used one time at most each game. It feels like a tacked on mechanic that does not fit the theme nor does it feel worth it based on action options and the Haunt mechanic. You can either use an action to take a ghost guaranteed, or burn actions to get to someone's space and gamble stealing a ghost. Between the gamble and the danger of gaining Haunt, Dueling never feels useful enough to take-on, especially later in the game once more Haunt cards have been dealt out, which I will cover more in the section specifically about the Haunt mechanic.
<br><br>
<i>Board Positioning:</i> To collect ghosts, a player must move around the board to different rooms. Also, players can gain Haunts if the Hitchhiking Ghosts move through or land on their space. While it would feel like there should be a lot strategy in board positions, often, it is quite obvious where you need to move. Trying to rotate the board to hurt other players doesn't often come into play, or rather it feels inadvertent because you moved the board to help yourself which just so happens to hurt/help another play. And rotating the board for one action makes movement even more easy. If you are hit by the Hitchhiking Ghosts, it is more random, although it does add some push your luck into the game by taking the chance to sit on the outside board (hallway) longer rather than return back to the center of the board (seance room).

<i>Push Your Luck and the Haunt mechanic:</i> One of the core mechanics of the game outside of collecting sets of ghosts is gaining and managing Haunt cards. Haunt cards are numbered 1-3 and can be obtained many ways in the game. At the end of the game, players total the value of all of their Haunt cards and the player with the most Haunt loses all of one type of Ghost that they have most of. Haunts act as a sort of penalty for taking certain actions or gambling on the board. And they can generally only be discarded through collecting one type of Ghost or actually wasting two actions (move+discard) to use the seance room. While Haunt has a good premise, in practice there are some major flaws in the mechanic.
First issue is part of how Haunts are distributed. The biggest way to gain Haunts is when the Hitchhiking Ghosts move across a players space or land on it. If it lands on a player, they gain two Haunts instead of one, which is a big penalty and mostly due purely to randomness. You also gain Haunt whenever you collect a ghost in the same space as the Hitchhiking Ghosts, which is a double penalty for whom the hitchhikers land on (making you lose an action to get away from them, or gain additional Haunt). Again, it is generally purely random how the Hitchhiking Ghosts move and land. The randomness removes a lot of strategy and adds some severe penalties for it. You can also gain Haunts through other card effects or Dueling, but that is less often and may not even matter when we get to the other big issue with Haunts.
Once a player obviously has more Haunts than the rest the other players (as seen through having one giant stack of Haunt cards), the game makes a dramatic shift for the worst. If a player has an extreme amount of Haunt cards, it is no longer worth their actions or time to discard Haunt cards. Now, there is no need for them to manage Haunt and one big part of the game is removed. Worse, other players now rarely need to manage Haunt because they know they still have less then the person in the lead. Not only does this make the action in discarding Haunt cards almost worthless, Dueling becomes even more pointless when gaining Haunt cards does not mean almost anything to the players involved. But, all the events or ghosts that give out Haunt cards feel less useful when the majority of players are not managing Haunt cards any more. And no one aside from the player in the lead with Haunt cards will be penalized. While Haunting seems like a great mechanic, it really did not feel like it worked as intended. Also, when it feels like a mechanic is being ignored in a game (like Dueling as well), you have to question why it is even there or if it is implemented correctly. While I am not entirely sure I described what is wrong with the Haunt mechanic, something definitely feels off as everyone whom I played the game with agreed.
<br><br>
<b>Player Count Differences:</b>
While the game can be played with up to six, I only played it up to four. Interestingly enough, player counts 2,3, and 4 all feel different. At two players, collecting ghost sets often felt too easy and managing Haunts seemed silly since once one person had a dramatic lead in Haunts, there was no way to catch back up in reducing Haunts. Thus, the player with less Haunts could essentially not worry about it as a penalty. At three players, there was a bit more back and forth in the fight for ghost sets and managing Haunts. At four players, there were times where there was little options for ghosts on the board, which sort of made turn order matter a lot, and thus add more randomness to the game as far as who gets to go first when certain cards showed up. And once one player had been hit multiple times by the Hitchhiking Ghosts no one was concerned about Haunts except for the player with Madame Leota (who scores 10 extra points if you have the least Haunt at the end of the game). In all player counts, Dueling was largely irrelevant and the Haunt management got odd with players eventually not being all that concerned whether they gained Haunts or not.
One thing that is odd that this game does not do (and it is a common problem in a lot of games), the deck distribution does not vary based on player counts. So sometimes certain sets are very easy to get, or sometimes you will rarely see any of certain ghost types.
<br><br>
<b>Overall Rating 5/10:</b>
The game is quick and light with amazing art and generally overall nice components. The simple set collecting is fun, but very basic overall. Unfortunately, the rest of the mechanics do not mesh as well as I would hope. While it appears to be strategic, luck some times feels overwhelming. Dueling feels like a completely unnecessary and non-thematic mechanic. Haunt management, while an interesting idea, falls short with a bunch of weird situations due to how cards are distributed and how it warps gameplay. Fortunately, being a huge Haunted Mansion fan, I plan on working on some fixes to issues myself and my fellow players found in the game. Keep an eye on these forums for more variants I try out.
