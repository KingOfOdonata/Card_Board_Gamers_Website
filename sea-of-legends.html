    <h2>Finally, we take to the sea! But was it legendary?</h2>
    <h5><i>Author: Travis Schneider, Session Date: March 28th, 2021</i></h5>
  <p>After doing an unboxing for this game, I was extremely excited to get it to the table once the App was available. Once the App dropped, I went over the rules and got most of the game setup before my friend came over. What follows is a sort of single-play review of our experience.<br><br>
  Our first session was a 2-player game against the Dread Horde and the Children of Tlaloc. Things started smoothly for the most part, even with some of the fiddliness you expect in a first game. But then we found ourselves constantly checking the rules and missing certain things. Fortunately, the designers have been active on Discord answering rules questions, but I still wonder how many things we might have done wrong we thought we did right. Whenever we got to go adventuring and play with the app for the story moments, we got excited. But as the game went on, we realized we rarely got to utilize that part of the game, a part we thought was essential and the most interesting. So as we finished the last round with a battle against Tetzahuitl (where we realized we actually lost the game a round or two earlier since she had four "relics," including one she stole from me, thinking she only counted Summoning Relics), we ended on a note of disappointment. We did not completely hate the game by any means, but we were very underwhelmed.<br><br>
  The board play was for the most part things we've seen before-go to locations for certain effects, battle creatures and maybe other players, control a spreading threat, and find special items to give us new abilities. But the game has three big things that should make it stand out-the dice that can act as a resource as well as system to manipulate, the Lover/Nemesis cards (Which give special abilities and offer unique adventuring opportunities), and most of the all, the App that controls the Adventure and narrative.<br><br>
  Unfortunately, the game feels very obviously unfinished and/or barely blind play-tested. Between the mismatched icons on the reference card (which is one of the smaller problems), the buggy app (which is critical to the game working), and the jumbled rulebook, you can tell they had to rush it through production and into players' hands. Trust me, I am just as disappointed as most. I was extremely excited about the game and did an unboxing for it on YouTube as well. I love games that really bring an element of adventure to the table and this game promised that big time.<br><br>
  The rulebook is kind of wild. I read the rulebook pretty quickly and thought, "oh, this is pretty easy." It really does seem simple just from a quick read of the rules. But upon playing, things start to become messy. The port actions and adventuring are plenty straight forward. But the challenges and the NPC behavior causes everything to slow to a halt trying to consistently resolve all of the movements and attacks. Player turns typically are so fast it often feels like you aren't doing that much on your own turn, and then doing much more on the Faction phase.<br><br>
  Then after a 2+ hour 2-player game, I could not believe we only used the App 7 times. I had to ask myself why even have my computer on for that long. Whenever we did go on an adventure, it was exciting and interesting. But that happened so little compared to the rest of the game, which I then have to ask why have an app at all. Just have encounter cards to flip, which would have been much cheaper and easier to create.<br><br>
  Speaking of the app, I cannot believe the app wasn't also used to track phases, and assist in resolving the Faction turns, especially event cards. It was even missing the background music, which seems kind of crazy. And in an age with games like Forgotten Waters (still the epitome of App board games for me), when a game is suppose to have a critical app-element to the game, it needs to deliver at launch.<br><br>
  I'm sure the company will be going into overtime to fix this game. Otherwise, they will not even be able to attempt a second game on Kickstarter like they were planning. This game has tons of potential and can still be fixed. It needs a ton of blind playtesting (Which us first time purchasers have now become) and then a rulebook revision. I also think some mechanics will need to be improved. Adventuring should be happening often in this game, as the App aspect is the most interesting part of this game. While I do not like entertaining house rules after only a single play, I am considering not making adventuring cost an action. Once per turn, if you are in an Adventure location, you can go on an adventure. And if this speeds the game up too much, just increase notoriety to win to 11 or 12. Increasing difficulty in semi-coop games is never difficult.<br><br>
  <img class="covers" alt="Sea King Miniature" src="../Card_Board_Gamers_Website/Images/Sea-Of-Legends/Sea-Monster.jpg"> major complaints about components. Quality is overall great, art and miniatures is amazing, graphic design is good (not great), and everything works fine overall. The only thing I didn't like were the tiny tokens to track levels of Followers and Lover/Nemesis. They move around a lot and don't stand out.
  Anyways, session rant over. If you have any questions about more detailed parts of our experience or our game, please let me know.
