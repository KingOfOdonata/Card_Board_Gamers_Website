      <h2>Outlive: An Intense 4 Player Game and Final Thoughts</h2>
      <h5><i>Author: Travis Schneider, Session Date: July 23, 2017</i></h5>
      So, I got to play my copy of Outlive with 4 people yesterday (having only played a 2-player game previously) and I really enjoyed it. The game felt tight as resources were constantly running out and pressure was really...putting pressure on other players. There are so many things to consider with each movement-resource gathering for feeding your survivors, building rooms, repairing equipment, and solving events. And then you have to consider if someone's bigger hero could come in a put pressure on you and vice versa. Each move has so many consequences I find it very intriguing.
<br><br>
And all the things that can hurt you I love in this game and never once felt picked on, whether it was an event causing some devastating changes or a bigger group of heroes coming in and raiding my party. Everything is really thematic and flows really well. And you always can work around what is going on by gathering the correct resources or carefully planning your moves and buildings. We even had the events that boost the endurance on animals by 1 and decrease their food value by 1. And one player had the hawk that can steal meat. Food got really tight as a result of all these things and it was really awesome as it caused some smart playing as well as aggressive moves.
<br><br>
I did win the game with 28 points and the person in last with like -9 or something like that (I didn't count and they picked up their things quickly). Seemed like a dramatic spread but I have a feeling with multiple plays and experience, that spread would shrink. I never once felt like something that happened to me or the other players were the result of some random effect or bad luck, but more so due to our plays. Sure, the city tiles are random, as are events and starting buildings, but all are relatively open information you can plan around. Never go to city planning on finding a specific thing, look at it as more of a bonus option unless you are getting equipment and/or causing pressure.
<br><br>
One player felt like the game really had a rich get richer feel to it, but I really don't see it. Sure, in ANY worker placement/resource management game, when someone manages to accumulate lots of resources, they can sometimes maintain a lead. But in this game, you also have to constantly spend resources to just maintain your shelter and keep your survivors alive. There were many rounds that I dropped down to 1 or 0 commodities and low materials but I was able to come back from it. One player also didn't like how game altering the need to hunt for food was but I don't understand how you make a resource management post-apocalyptic game without food being hard to acquire and thus game altering.
<br><br>
So, my only current issue with the game is 2 players vs 4 players. With 4 players, the game was tight and there was a lot of fighting over resources and causing pressure. In the 2 player game, resources were hardly ever an issue and pressure pretty much never happened (in fact, even when we could possibly make a move to cause pressure, we ignored it, taking a different move that more greatly benefited one player). Bullets were only ever used for hunting or solving events in the two player game, but were used quite a bit in the 4 player game. In fact, I think bullets were actually under-valued early, not realizing how useful they were at protecting oneself from pressure and then how they can be used in conjunction with hunting to allow both the gathering of food and materials. We also had the event pop up where we had to lose either two materials or two bullets, thus their importance increased.
<br><br>
Not sure what change I would make for 2 players (I've yet to try the Horde expansion) but for the main game, I could see drafting rooms instead of dealing them out randomly. It would add some more strategy as well as mitigate drawing multiples of the same room.
