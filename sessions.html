      <h2>Finally, we take to the sea! But was it legendary?</h2>
      <h5><i>Author: Travis Schneider, Session Date: March 28th, 2021</i></h5>
    <p class="read-more-wrap"><span class="read-more-target">After doing an unboxing for this game, I was extremely excited to get it to the table once the App was available. Once the App dropped, I went over the rules and got most of the game setup before my friend came over. What follows is a sort of single-play review of our experience.<br><br>
    Our first session was a 2-player game against the Dread Horde and the Children of Tlaloc. Things started smoothly for the most part, even with some of the fiddliness you expect in a first game. But then we found ourselves constantly checking the rules and missing certain things. Fortunately, the designers have been active on Discord answering rules questions, but I still wonder how many things we might have done wrong we thought we did right. Whenever we got to go adventuring and play with the app for the story moments, we got excited. But as the game went on, we realized we rarely got to utilize that part of the game, a part we thought was essential and the most interesting. So as we finished the last round with a battle against Tetzahuitl (where we realized we actually lost the game a round or two earlier since she had four "relics," including one she stole from me, thinking she only counted Summoning Relics), we ended on a note of disappointment. We did not completely hate the game by any means, but we were very underwhelmed.<br><br>
    The board play was for the most part things we've seen before-go to locations for certain effects, battle creatures and maybe other players, control a spreading threat, and find special items to give us new abilities. But the game has three big things that should make it stand out-the dice that can act as a resource as well as system to manipulate, the Lover/Nemesis cards (Which give special abilities and offer unique adventuring opportunities), and most of the all, the App that controls the Adventure and narrative.<br><br>
    Unfortunately, the game feels very obviously unfinished and/or barely blind play-tested. Between the mismatched icons on the reference card (which is one of the smaller problems), the buggy app (which is critical to the game working), and the jumbled rulebook, you can tell they had to rush it through production and into players' hands. Trust me, I am just as disappointed as most. I was extremely excited about the game and did an unboxing for it on YouTube as well. I love games that really bring an element of adventure to the table and this game promised that big time.<br><br>
    The rulebook is kind of wild. I read the rulebook pretty quickly and thought, "oh, this is pretty easy." It really does seem simple just from a quick read of the rules. But upon playing, things start to become messy. The port actions and adventuring are plenty straight forward. But the challenges and the NPC behavior causes everything to slow to a halt trying to consistently resolve all of the movements and attacks. Player turns typically are so fast it often feels like you aren't doing that much on your own turn, and then doing much more on the Faction phase.<br><br>
    Then after a 2+ hour 2-player game, I could not believe we only used the App 7 times. I had to ask myself why even have my computer on for that long. Whenever we did go on an adventure, it was exciting and interesting. But that happened so little compared to the rest of the game, which I then have to ask why have an app at all. Just have encounter cards to flip, which would have been much cheaper and easier to create.<br><br>
    Speaking of the app, I cannot believe the app wasn't also used to track phases, and assist in resolving the Faction turns, especially event cards. It was even missing the background music, which seems kind of crazy. And in an age with games like Forgotten Waters (still the epitome of App board games for me), when a game is suppose to have a critical app-element to the game, it needs to deliver at launch.<br><br>
    I'm sure the company will be going into overtime to fix this game. Otherwise, they will not even be able to attempt a second game on Kickstarter like they were planning. This game has tons of potential and can still be fixed. It needs a ton of blind playtesting (Which us first time purchasers have now become) and then a rulebook revision. I also think some mechanics will need to be improved. Adventuring should be happening often in this game, as the App aspect is the most interesting part of this game. While I do not like entertaining house rules after only a single play, I am considering not making adventuring cost an action. Once per turn, if you are in an Adventure location, you can go on an adventure. And if this speeds the game up too much, just increase notoriety to win to 11 or 12. Increasing difficulty in semi-coop games is never difficult.<br><br>
    <img class="covers" alt="Sea King Miniature" src="../Card_Board_Gamers_Website/Images/Sea-Of-Legends/Sea-Monster.jpg"> major complaints about components. Quality is overall great, art and miniatures is amazing, graphic design is good (not great), and everything works fine overall. The only thing I didn't like were the tiny tokens to track levels of Followers and Lover/Nemesis. They move around a lot and don't stand out.
    Anyways, session rant over. If you have any questions about more detailed parts of our experience or our game, please let me know.

      <h2>Outlive: An Intense 4 Player Game and Final Thoughts</h2>
      <h5><i>Author: Travis Schneider, Session Date: July 23, 2017</i></h5>
      <p class="read-more-wrap"><span class="read-more-target">So, I got to play my copy of Outlive with 4 people yesterday (having only played a 2-player game previously) and I really enjoyed it. The game felt tight as resources were constantly running out and pressure was really...putting pressure on other players. There are so many things to consider with each movement-resource gathering for feeding your survivors, building rooms, repairing equipment, and solving events. And then you have to consider if someone's bigger hero could come in a put pressure on you and vice versa. Each move has so many consequences I find it very intriguing.
<br><br>
And all the things that can hurt you I love in this game and never once felt picked on, whether it was an event causing some devastating changes or a bigger group of heroes coming in and raiding my party. Everything is really thematic and flows really well. And you always can work around what is going on by gathering the correct resources or carefully planning your moves and buildings. We even had the events that boost the endurance on animals by 1 and decrease their food value by 1. And one player had the hawk that can steal meat. Food got really tight as a result of all these things and it was really awesome as it caused some smart playing as well as aggressive moves.
<br><br>
I did win the game with 28 points and the person in last with like -9 or something like that (I didn't count and they picked up their things quickly). Seemed like a dramatic spread but I have a feeling with multiple plays and experience, that spread would shrink. I never once felt like something that happened to me or the other players were the result of some random effect or bad luck, but more so due to our plays. Sure, the city tiles are random, as are events and starting buildings, but all are relatively open information you can plan around. Never go to city planning on finding a specific thing, look at it as more of a bonus option unless you are getting equipment and/or causing pressure.
<br><br>
One player felt like the game really had a rich get richer feel to it, but I really don't see it. Sure, in ANY worker placement/resource management game, when someone manages to accumulate lots of resources, they can sometimes maintain a lead. But in this game, you also have to constantly spend resources to just maintain your shelter and keep your survivors alive. There were many rounds that I dropped down to 1 or 0 commodities and low materials but I was able to come back from it. One player also didn't like how game altering the need to hunt for food was but I don't understand how you make a resource management post-apocalyptic game without food being hard to acquire and thus game altering.
<br><br>
So, my only current issue with the game is 2 players vs 4 players. With 4 players, the game was tight and there was a lot of fighting over resources and causing pressure. In the 2 player game, resources were hardly ever an issue and pressure pretty much never happened (in fact, even when we could possibly make a move to cause pressure, we ignored it, taking a different move that more greatly benefited one player). Bullets were only ever used for hunting or solving events in the two player game, but were used quite a bit in the 4 player game. In fact, I think bullets were actually under-valued early, not realizing how useful they were at protecting oneself from pressure and then how they can be used in conjunction with hunting to allow both the gathering of food and materials. We also had the event pop up where we had to lose either two materials or two bullets, thus their importance increased.
<br><br>
Not sure what change I would make for 2 players (I've yet to try the Horde expansion) but for the main game, I could see drafting rooms instead of dealing them out randomly. It would add some more strategy as well as mitigate drawing multiples of the same room.
